# PHYS-512-Project-Report
Repository for the final project report for Computational Physics class, shared with all group members and the professor. 

This repository contains the code used to generate movies of particle beam collisions (Visual_demonstration) and the produced videos (Movie_colisions and movie_hard_sphere). Additionally, it includes the computation of the total cross-section for muon pair production, varied as a function of energy from the center of mass (Energy_tests_no_display), and the code testing the calculation of cross-section for hard sphere scattering (hard_sphere_scattering).

Moreover, you can access the code used for the cross-section simulation from Pythia8 (Pythiaepluseminus) (Pythia8 installation is performed using 'conda install -c conda-forge pythia8'). 

Lastly, you'll find the code used to create the plot illustrating the theoretical total cross-section for muon creation (muon_creation_integrated).

Thank you for your attention.
